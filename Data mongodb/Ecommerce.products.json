Using these three supplements helps to reduce the nutritional deficiencies and stress which can trigger feather plucking.\n\nThis pack helps with calcium deficiencies, stress and prevents irritation when the new feathers grow.\n\nCalcivet (also known as CalciBoost) is a high quality liquid calcium and Vitamin D3 supplement, especially vital during breeding, and should be given weekly to all birds. African Greys have a particular requirement for this mineral.\n\nPotent Brew is a live probiotic which will increase the vigour of breeding birds, increase chick survival and improve the gut flora of any sick or stressed bird. Due to the nature of this product it can only be stored for 2-3 months before it starts to lose its benefits.\n\nEasy Bird Complete Pet Supplement combines the ingredients from Daily Essentials 3, Calcivet Powder, Bio Plus and a small amount from Pro Boost Super Max.\n\nPlease note: The EasyBird Complete Pet Supplement only has 2 days' worth of calcium in, split over 5 days dosage. The aim is to try and build up the calcium levels within your bird to help stop the nervousness and behavioural issues that can cause feather plucking.\n\nSo using all 3 products together at the same time is perfectly fine.\n\nUse the EasyBird and Calcivet 5 days per week and the Potent Brew daily (for about 1 month).
